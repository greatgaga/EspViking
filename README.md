# EspViking
Firmware made for ESP32 that is made for wifi pentesting.  
It is kind of Mr. Robot themed :)  
**If you go to change the code, please make it readable for other programmers.**

## Setting up the ESP32
The only thing you need to setup is the password and SSID of your network.  

## Notes
I know this project is very buggy and feel free to contact me.  
**Huge thanks to the Bjorn repo for a lot of inspiration in my project!** ([link](https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn/))
