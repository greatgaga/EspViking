# EspViking
Firmware made for ESP32 that is made for wifi pentesting.  
It is kind of Mr. Robot themed :)  
**If you go to change the code, please make it readable for other programmers.**

## Setting up the ESP32
Only things you need to setup is password and SSID of your network.
Feel free to change wordlists in data directory.

## Notes
I know this project is very buggy and feel free to contact me.
