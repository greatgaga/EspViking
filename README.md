# EspViking
Firmware made for ESP32 that is made for wifi pentesting.  
It is kind of Mr. Robot themed :)  
**If you go to change the code, please make it readable for other programmers.**

## Setting up the enviorment to flash the firmware on ESP32  
You will need to install VSCode ([link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).  
After that you will have to install the PlatformIO extension in VSCode.  
Also make sure to set up the board in platformio.ini file to the board that you are acctually using (most likely you are using the same board as I used).  
**(If you didnt know, you will also need internet connection so PlatformIO can install all the necessary libs)**  

## Setting up the ESP32
Only things you need to setup is password and SSID of your network.
Feel free to change wordlists in data directory.
